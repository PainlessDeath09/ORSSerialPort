# ORSSerialPort 

This is a fork of the ([ORSSerialPort](https://github.com/armadsen/ORSSerialPort)) Serial port library for Objective-C and Swift macOS apps

It incorporates a Swift wrapper around the system functions to interact with serial interfaces based on delegates and events and has been modified to work with [Seeed devices](https://www.seeedstudio.com).

Options for RTS and DTS has been added as well.

This has been tested and confirmed to work on macOS Sequoia(macOS 15) and also has been tested to work on the [Seeeduino XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/)
